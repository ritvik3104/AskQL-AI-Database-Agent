# ü§ñ AskQL - Ask Your DB

**AskQL** is a sophisticated, full-stack application that transforms how users interact with databases. It allows anyone to have a natural language conversation with their data, enabling them to ask complex analytical questions, retrieve information, and even perform administrative actions like modifying data or altering table structures ‚Äî all without writing a single line of SQL.

Built with a professional-grade tech stack, the application prioritizes security, performance, and user experience. It features a robust, role-based access system and an advanced AI core, making it a powerful and secure tool for any data-driven environment.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### Conversational AI for Database Interaction üí¨
- Users can ask complex questions and give commands in plain English.
- The system maintains a memory of the current conversation, allowing for contextual follow-up questions.
- The AI provides friendly, readable answers and automatically includes markdown tables for list-based queries, enhancing readability.

### Advanced RAG with Pinecone for Read-Only Mode üß†
- The "Read-Only" mode uses a state-of-the-art Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for high-level, context-aware reasoning.
- Instead of being overwhelmed by an entire database schema, the AI's context is intelligently built by first querying a Pinecone vector database.
- This retrieves only the most semantically relevant table and column descriptions for a user's specific question, making the AI dramatically more accurate and efficient at handling complex, multi-table analytical queries.

### Few-Shot Prompting for Complex Queries üéØ
- To handle highly complex, multi-step queries, the AI is given a "masterclass" in advanced SQL directly within its instructions.
- The prompt includes concrete examples of how to write sophisticated queries (using subqueries, CTEs, and window functions).
- This few-shot prompting technique significantly improves the AI's ability to solve difficult analytical problems that would otherwise fail.

### Secure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) üîê
- The application features a secure login screen where users must choose between a safe "Read/View Only" mode and a password-protected "Admin" mode.
- The backend uses two completely separate and isolated logic chains for each role, ensuring a read-only user can never access data-modifying capabilities.

### Full Database Privileges for Admin Role ‚úçÔ∏è
- Authenticated admins can perform a complete range of database operations, including SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE, and Data Definition Language (DDL) commands like ALTER TABLE.
- The Admin mode is equipped with the same "god-level" prompting as the read-only mode, ensuring it can handle both simple and complex queries with high accuracy.
- Features intelligent cache invalidation: after any successful write operation, the entire Redis cache is automatically flushed, guaranteeing that subsequent queries always retrieve the most up-to-date data.

### Multi-Database Connectivity üîÑ
- The project is database-agnostic and can be easily configured to connect to different SQL databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite.
- The connection is managed through a simple `config.yaml` file, allowing for easy switching without any code changes.

### High-Performance Caching with Redis ‚ö°
- Uses a high-speed Redis cache to store the results of previously asked questions.
- Dramatically improves the user experience for common queries by making the application more responsive.
- Reduces redundant calls to the LLM API.

### Professional UI with Speech-to-Text üé§
- Sleek, modern chat interface with a professional navy blue theme.
- Includes a robust speech-to-text feature, allowing users to speak their queries directly into the application using the browser's native Web Speech API.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Docker Desktop (for running Redis)
- Access to a SQL database (or use the default SQLite)

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd AskQL



2. Setup and Installation
Create a Virtual Environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Mac/Linux
# venv\Scripts\activate    # On Windows



Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Configure Environment Variables
Create a file named .env in the root directory.
Sign up for free accounts at Groq and Pinecone.
Add your keys and set an admin password:

GROQ_API_KEY="YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY"
PINECONE_API_KEY="YOUR_PINECONE_API_KEY"
ADMIN_PASSWORD="your_secure_password"


Configure the Database
Open backend/config.yaml.

To use the default SQLite database, no changes are needed.

To connect to your own PostgreSQL or MySQL database, update the relevant profile with your credentials and change active_database to match the profile name (e.g., postgres_example).

Initialize the Database and Pinecone Index
If using the default SQLite setup, run the database initialization script:

python backend/data/init_db.py
hen, run the schema indexing script to populate your Pinecone vector database.
You only need to do this once, or whenever your database schema changes:
python scripts/index_schema.py


‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Application
You will need three separate terminals:

Terminal 1: Start the Redis Server
Make sure Docker Desktop is running.
Run this command to start the Redis container:


docker run --name my-redis -p 6379:6379 -d redis
(If it‚Äôs already running, you can use docker start my-redis)

Terminal 2: Start the Backend Server
Activate the virtual environment and navigate to the backend directory:



cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload
Terminal 3: Start the Frontend Application
Open a new terminal, activate the virtual environment, then navigate to the frontend directory and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd frontend
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
Your browser should automatically open the application.
